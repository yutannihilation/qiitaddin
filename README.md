RStudio Addin to Post to Qiita
==============================

*Caution: This package is in the verrrrry early stages.*

### Installation

```r
library(devtools)
install_github("yutannihilation/qiitaddin")
```

### Usage

After making sure that the target R Markdown file is active, click "Post to Qiita".

Review the knitted Markdown document and click "Done". Then, provide your Qiita access token to another dialogue.

After that, the document is quietly(this needs to be inproved) posted to Qiita as a private post.

There are two important things you have to be careful about:

* Since no method to upload images is provided by Qiita API, this package uses Imgur experimentally.
* Qiita is more formal place than Rpubs; Qiita people may get mad at you if you publish some test document that is not for sharing your knowledge, but for just testing Qiita API and this package. Never make it public.
